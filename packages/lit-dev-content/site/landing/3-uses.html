    <h3>Standalone Components</h3>

      don't own, built on a variety of tech stacks? Web components are the perfect
      solution, and Lit makes them easy to build.</p>

    <h3>Design systems</h3>
    <p>A design system helps you create experiences that are consistently on
      brand. But if your organization uses multiple frameworks, design system
    maintenance can become crushingly expensive. Use Lit to build one set of web
    components that works for every team.</p>

    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <p>Lit is also a great choice for building sites and apps. Use it as a
    standards-centric alternative to React or Vue, or add Lit components to
    progressively enhance your statically rendered site.</p>
