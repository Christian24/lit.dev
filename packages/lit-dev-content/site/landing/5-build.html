      <h4>Lit is lightning fast</h4>
      <p>Weighing in at just 5 kB (minified and compressed), Lit helps keep your
      bundle size small and your loading time short. And UI updates are
      lightning-fast, because Lit only re-renders the dynamic parts–no diffing
      required.</h4>

      <h4>Lit is standards based</h4>
      <p>You’re in good hands with Lit. We’ve been involved with Web Components
      from day one and remain actively engaged in standards work. Every Lit
      feature is carefully designed with platform evolution in mind, helping you
      take full advantage of the modern web.</h4>

      <h4>Lit is future-ready</h4>
      <p>By using the browser’s native component model, Lit minimizes lock-in
      and maximizes flexibility. You’ll be able to update to a major new version
      of Lit or migrate to another Web Components library one component at a
      time safely, without disrupting product development.</p>
